A curated list of awesome datasets with human label variation (un-aggregated labels) in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision, including links to papers. The focus is on datasets that contain multiple annotations per instance, to enable learning with human label variation/disagreement. The starting point is Table 1 in the appendix of [our paper](). Feel free to contribute by creating a pull request as outlined in [contributing.md](contributing.md).
